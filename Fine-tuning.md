Pre-train model uses a massive amount of unstructured data, and requires memory optimization and parallel compute strategy. 

Instruction fine tuning is supervised learning, using labeled prompt - completion pairs. It can be full fine tuning, which requires similar memory and compute resources. Or it can 

Prepare your data: 
- format data as instruction (via prompt template library)
